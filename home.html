                    Salem, Oregon. Inspired by my academic background, I made the decision to venture into the field of
                    Web Development. Since then, I have been actively engaging in online courses to enhance my
                    proficiency in both front-end and back-end programming languages. I am currently seeking employment
                    opportunities that provide a platform for me to contribute to a dynamic team. I am

                    The main focus of the project revolves around the
                    <span class="code">validateCred()</span> function, which takes an input array containing credit card
                    numbers and applies the criteria for credit card validation. It accurately determines whether a
                    credit card number is valid or not, and returns a boolean value as output. Additionally, the <span
                        class="code">findInvalidCards()</span> function plays a crucial role by iterating through a
                    nested array of credit card numbers. It utilizes the <span class="code">validateCred()</span>
                    function to identify and extract the invalid credit card numbers, storing them in a new nested array
                    that is subsequently returned.<br><br><img

                <li id="project4">⯈ Mysterious Organism</li>
                <p id="project-description4">&emsp;The context of this project is that a fictional new organism has been
                    found at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents and was named Pila
                    aequor. In the code below, the <span class="code">returnRandBase()</span> function returns a random
                    DNA base of Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine. Since the organism is comprised of only 15 DNA
                    bases, the
                    function <span class="code">mockUpStrand()</span> generates an array containing 15 bases. The
                    factory function <span class="code">pAequorFactory()</span> takes in two inputs, a number that must
                    be unique to each organism and an array generated
                    by <span class="code">mockUpStrand()</span>. The <span class="code">.mutate()</span> method changes
                    a DNA base in the array as a way to simulate the Pila aequor's high rate of mutation. The <span
                        class="code">.compareDNA()</span> method takes one
                    pAequorObject as an input and calculates the percentage of <span class="code">.dna</span> that it
                    shares in common with the current pAequor. These organisms are more likely to survive if their DNA
                    is made up
                    of at least 60% <span class="code">'C'</span> or <span class="code">'G'</span> bases, so the <span
                        class="code">.willLikelySurvive()</span> method returns a boolean based on whether or not this
                    is true. The <span class="code">.complementStrand()</span> method simply finds the
                    complement of the P. Aequor's DNA strand by matching <span class="code">'A'</span>s with <span
                        class="code">'T'</span>s and <span class="code">'C'</span>s with <span class="code">'G'</span>s.
                    Finally, the <span class="code">arrayOfSurvivors()</span> function continues to generate new DNA
                    strands until 30
                    likely survivors are added to a new array that is returned.<br><br><img

                        target="_blank">This</a> project is a website built using Django, a Python framework. While the
                    design maintains simplicity, the primary focus was on functionality. The website serves as an
                    inventory management system specifically designed for restaurant owners. It enables users to track
                    inventory stock, expenses, revenue, and profit as purchases are made.Upon visiting the homepage, you
                    will find limited content until you register and log in. Once
                    authenticated, you gain access to the various models. Each page allows you to add, update, or delete
                    items as necessary. The inventory page facilitates the addition of items, their unit prices, and
                    current stock levels. Similarly, the menu page allows the addition of menu items along with their
                    respective prices. Furthermore, you can conveniently update the recipes for each menu item. When a
                    customer makes a
                    purchase, the purchase page enables you to record the transaction. In doing
                    so, the inventory items used in the recipes are automatically deducted from the stock on the
                    inventory page. As an overview, the report page tracks revenue from the purchases model and
                    expenses from the inventory model. By subtracting the two, it presents the total profit generated.
