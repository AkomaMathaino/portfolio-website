                        from Corban University in Salem, Oregon. After graduating, I decided to go in the direction of Web Developing and 
                        have been pursuing online courses in both front-end and back-end languages. I am interested in finding a job where 
                        I might be given the opportunity to expand my skillset.</p>

                        I used HTML and CSS to create a webpage that displays various colors with their hex and rgb values, fonts with their font-styles, and text style examples for the p, h1, and h2 elements.</p>

                        I began with the design spec below and used flexbox in its design.<br><br><img src="Projects/Tea Cozy - Flexbot/img-tea-cozy-redline.webp" alt="Tea Cozy design spec" width="100%"></p>

                    <p id="project-description3">&emsp;This is a small project I completed in Javascript. In the code below, the <span class="code">validateCred()</span> function takes an array storing a credit card number as input and uses the criteria for credit 
                        card validation to determine whether or not it is valid, which then outputs a boolean. The <span class="code">findInvalidCards()</span> function iterates through a nested array of credit card numbers and uses the validateCred function to push those 
                        that are invalid into a new nested array that is then returned.<br><br><img src="Projects/Credit Card Checker/credit card checker.png" alt="Credit Card Checker Code" width="100%"></p>
                    <li id="project4">⯈ Mysterious Organism</li>
                    <p id="project-description4">&emsp;The context of this project is that a fictional new organism has been found at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents and was named Pila 
                        aequor. In the code below, the <span class="code">returnRandBase()</span> function returns a random DNA base of Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine. Since the organism is comprised of only 15 DNA bases, the 
                        function <span class="code">mockUpStrand()</span> generates an array containing 15 bases. The factory function <span class="code">pAequorFactory()</span> takes in two inputs, a number that must be unique to each organism and an array genarated 
                        by <span class="code">mockUpStrand()</span>. The <span class="code">.mutate()</span> method changes a DNA base in the array as a way to simulate the Pila aequor's high rate of mutation. The <span class="code">.compareDNA()</span> method takes one 
                        pAequorObject as an input and calculates the percentage of <span class="code">.dna</span> that it shares in common with the current pAequor. These organisms are more likely to survive if their DNA is made up 
                        of at least 60% <span class="code">'C'</span> or <span class="code">'G'</span> bases, so the <span class="code">.willLikelySurvive()</span> method returns a boolean based on whether or not this is true. The <span class="code">.complementStrand()</span> method simply finds the 
                        complement of the P. Aequor's DNA strand by matching <span class="code">'A'</span>s with <span class="code">'T'</span>s and <span class="code">'C'</span>s with <span class="code">'G'</span>s. Finally, the <span class="code">arrayOfSurvivors()</span> function continues to generate new DNA strands until 30 
                        likely survivors are added to a new array that is returned.<br><br><img src="Projects/Mysterious Organism/mystery organism code.png" alt="Mysterious Organism Code" width="100%PP"></p>
                    <li id="project5">⯈ Django Delights</li>
                    <p id="project-description5">&emsp;<a href="https://django-delights.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">This</a> website is my largest project which was created using Python's django 
                        framework. The design is fairly simple because my focus was primarily on the functionality, which is to allow a restaurant owner to keep track of inventory stock, as well as 
                        expenses, revenue, and profit as purchases are being made. Until you register for an account, there isn't much on the homepage. Once you register and are logged in, you will have 
                        access to the models. As each page allows, you can then add, update, or delete items. On the inventory page you can add items, unit price, and stock. You can add menu 
                        items and their prices on the menu page as well as update the recipes for each item. When a customer makes a purchase, it can be recorded on the purchase page. The inventory 
                        items used in the recipe will then be subtracted from their stock on the inventory page. Finally, the report page tracks the revenue from the purchases model, the expenses from the inventory model, and subtracts the 
                        two to show your total profit.</p>
